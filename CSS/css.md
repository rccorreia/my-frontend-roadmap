# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code you use to style your webpage. It tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Prefer always the third option.
